# Tails-OS-Journal
Hacker-style log &amp; experiments with Tails OS



Exploring the world of **Tails OS** — the amnesic, Tor-routed operating system designed for privacy and anonymity.  
This repo is my running log of experiments, observations, and lessons.

## Why This Repo?  
Tails isn’t just another Linux distro — it’s a tool built for survival in a surveillance-heavy world.  
These notes are both a personal record and a resource for anyone curious about what Tails feels like to actually *use*.
