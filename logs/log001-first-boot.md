# [LOG 001] â€” Tails OS Deployed 

> Status: USB boot successful  
> Encryption: active  
> Network: rerouted through Tor  
> Footprints: none detected  

First contact with **Tails OS** complete.  
It doesnâ€™t *install* â€” it *vanishes*. Every session lives only in RAM, dissolving on shutdown like smoke in the wind.  

 Observations:  
- Default state = cloaked.  
- Persistence? Optional.  
- Identity leakage? Terminated at the source.  

Feels less like running an operating system and more like wearing an invisibility cloak sewn from encryption and paranoia.  

Next operations:  
- [ ] Map the terrain of Tor.  
- [ ] Stress-test anonymity layers.  
- [ ] Unlock persistence module.
